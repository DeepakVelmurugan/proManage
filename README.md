# proManage
 proManage is a project management website used to track projects and agile development lifecycle :recycle: .
 
 <strong>This project is split to multiple repositories since each repo is a micro-service.</strong>
 
 It strongly follows the architecture where each micro-service will be communicating with each other, and data is transmitted in JSON format with the help of REST API (HTTP protocols)
 
 <i>Currently it's under construction :wrench:</i>
 
 ## Frontend components
 
 Technology not decided yet :walking: , mostly React, HTML, JS, CSS etc connecting to backend and making API calls to fetch data.
